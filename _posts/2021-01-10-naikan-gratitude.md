Practicing more gratitude is a worthy goal. To get started, I ask myself: “Can you think of a list of 10 things you feel grateful for?” It works great on the first day.

The next day I can do it, but it takes more effort. By day three, I know this habit won’t scale. It’s getting harder while sounding repetitive. It becomes a nuisance rather than a source of gratitude.

Every Thanksgiving, my family goes around the table and says what we’re grateful for. This quickly turns into a complicated task. 

I wonder, “Is it cliquè to always say ‘my family’? Shouldn’t it be more original, eloquent, all-encompassing yet concise?” I usually end up saying ‘my family’ and prepare to eat more yams.

I’ve learned something recently that turns the idea of feeling gratitude on its head.

Instead of asking, “What do I feel grateful for?” ask, 
**“What am I receiving?”**

That’s a question that only won’t tire but will inevitably induce gratitude. I’m receiving air, a quiet room to write in, warm food, pleasant company, use of WiFi...the list is endless. 

This question comes from a less well-known form of self-reflection developed in Japan called Naikan. Like Stoic practices like the view from above, Naikan helps us see more of life, refocusing our attention on all we receive from others and the world.

When I ask myself this question every day, I start to notice how I’m drowning in gifts. I’m profoundly humbled, grateful, and inspired to try to balance out my meager giving with my overwhelming receiving. 

And that’s far from being a nuisance.
