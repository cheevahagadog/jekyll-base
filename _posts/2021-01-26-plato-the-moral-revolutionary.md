Almost 2400 years ago, one of the greatest revolutions the western world has ever known set off. 
It was a relatively quiet explosion, not a famous battle or the overthrow of an empire. It was a young man watching his hero, teacher, and mentor put on trial and condemned to death. His teacher had dedicated his life to questioning others, for, as he put it, "the unexamined life is not worth living."
This was the trial of Socrates in Athens, Greece. Socrates never wrote his beliefs, preferring face-to-face discussion. Yet 2400 years later, almost entirely thanks to Plato, the young man at the trial, Socrates' name is ubiquitous.
Plato grew up in the shadows of the heroes of Homer. He came from a well-to-do family in Athens, was well educated, a good wrestler and had political career opportunities. 
But after meeting Socrates, Plato found higher truth in the wisdom of a poor older man's mission to seek to understand what makes the best human life. Plato devoted his life to uncovering truth and knowledge. His intellect matched his acute sense of moral obligation to improve his countrymen and the world.
Athens was not without standards and idols for human perfection. For centuries, Greeks revered Homer, the epic poet. The dramatic characters and heroism of men like Achilles, Ajax, and Agamemnon were Greek civilization's bedrock. Their deeds set the standard for bravery, virtue and manly action. These heroes were the role models of physical strength and daring in a time when war and violence were common and where winning meant survival.
Plato saw a defect in his culture. How honorable and virtuous could Athens be if it voted to execute a man like Socrates? What good is all that poetry if it inspires bravery and honor while failing to denounce the darker sides of human nature: greed, murder, cruelty?
For Plato, it was time for a revolution.
