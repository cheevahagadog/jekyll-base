A few months back, I saw a tweet from a woman whose mother was in a nursing home suffering from dementia, frequently confused and agitated. The only thing that soothed her mother was the soothing and familiar voice of Dan Rather narrating his audiobook _What Unites Us_. 

I just finished it today and found it steadying and encouraging. Bookended by essays on patriotism and citizenship, it's chock-full of top-notch essays and reflections on the arts, voting, character, and many more. Here are some of my top highlights:

Patriotism is a dialogue with fellow citizens "about not only what you love about your country but also about how it can be improved." "Patriotism is rooted in humility. Nationalism is rooted in arrogance."
Rather advocates tolerance but says it is only "a prerequisite for a functional democracy." On its own, it is insufficient, "allow[ing] us to accept others without engaging with them." **Tolerance is only a stop along the way towards** _**"a much grander destination of inclusion."**_

In the afterward, Rather realizes that the book's title has turned from a statement into an urgent question for many of us: "What unites us?!"

For this unusually jarring time, this book is a collection of reasons to hope that we will live to "see healing where there was once hatred." 

"There is still a place for optimism, but only if it is bolstered by hard work, perseverance, and a commitment by each of us to improve the well-being of our communities."

Read this book if you can. It inspired me to be a more active citizen. It steadies the troubling present with decades of personal perspective. It disentangles the idea of patriotism from nationalism and offers a compelling case for betting on a brighter future.
