I wasn't always a six-figure programmer. I didn't make it ten pages into the first programming book I bought. I was too afraid I'd blow up my college computer because I had to use the terminal. 

No exaggeration to say I was a bit of a computer coward.

Fast forward 15 months: I'm graduating from a data science boot camp in NYC, with places like the UN, NYPD, and tech companies wondering if I'd be interested in working for them. My mind was blown.

Remembering successful times can be more than just good reminiscing. In Switch, Chip and Dan Heath call these events "bright spots -- successful efforts worth emulating." 

The times when you figured out what worked; when you succeeded at something.

Right now, writing is my new coding but with way more personal vulnerability. The self-doubt can be debilitating at times. 

But if I can teach myself to code, then why can't I develop my writing? The fact that I've climbed several mountains before makes the next one less scary.

It's easy to remember the times in life when we got Cs, Ds or even Fs rather than our As. But this is deficient because it forgets previous accomplishments. 

**Instead, take a page from your own playbook and see how you succeeded before.**

Look for the bright spots. Not only is it a boost of self-esteem, but proof that you pulled through. 

And that means you can do it again.
