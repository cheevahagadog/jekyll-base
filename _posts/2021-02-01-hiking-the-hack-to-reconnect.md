After I got married, I unknowingly made a colossal mistake. I withdrew into my marriage and lost touch with my friends. It was a typical, "you don't know what you have untilâ€¦" scenario. 

Assuming things would remain the same, I forgot to reach out, and the relationships slowly withered.

Years later, as I realized my mistake, I tried to reach out and make contact again. It seemed too late for most of my high school and college chums. 

Some I didn't have their contact info, some moved away, and those still around were similarly busy with family and jobs. Hanging out, watching movies, or playing basketball was often too much work to coordinate or only offered fleeting chances for small talk.

I did get a few bites though. Usually it settled on "let's grab lunch sometime." That was before the pandemic. Even then, you'd only have your lunch break, minus travel time. Waiting in a line to order your food and then trying to talk between chews at a noisy burger joint, the conversations averaged around logistics: How's work? Do you like your job? How's Lauren? etc. 

Then last year, I finally discovered a hack: hiking!

Hiking is dedicating a good chunk of time to adventure together. Out there, there are no kids, jobs, or cell-phones to distract us, only the scenery. And we are free to fill the time to talk about our experiences, beliefs, challenges, and favorite movie quotes. 

Hiking together is an old treatment for a modern malady: loneliness and lack of connection. 

I've discovered hiking as not only a fun physical activity but as a powerful and pandemic friendly technology for connecting with friends. 

Maybe it's something else for you, but make sure you do it. It will make your 2021.
