As we start 2021 with hope, we carry heavy lessons from turbulent 2020. Exactly what the lessons are and how we will interpret them in the coming months is less clear. 

What's more consistent is our yearning for things to be normal again.

**But if returning to normal means returning to a state that could set off 2020 again, I'm not sure normal is a good thing.**

In 1871, after a fire devoured Chicago's wooden city, going back to normal might have meant building the city with wood again. The plague and devastating fires doubly hit London in 1666.

I once heard a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. This phrase makes more sense to me now. 

If all we take from 2020 is to stockpile more toilet paper, guns or to provide more COVID testing, we miss the chance to make ourselves and our society more resilient. 

Placing all our hopes on the vaccine is narrow-minded resignation. At best, it can impede COVID-19 but not cure the illnesses of 2020. That's deeper than a needle can go.

**Challenges and disasters are opportunities to emerge stronger.** We learn, adapt and grow forward, creating a new normal.

London rebuilt the city with stone and brick. Chicago with skyscrapers. In a historical sense, for those that persist, such optimism and alacrity create a better normal. 

We've done it before. Now is a chance to be persuaded by calamity to look beyond our old normal towards healing, rebuilding and unity.
