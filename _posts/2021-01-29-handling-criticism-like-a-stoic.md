**Ask: Is it true?**

No matter the truth, a Stoic wants it and can handle it. Marcus Aurelius, a Roman Emperor and a Stoic knew that living in the dirty river of denial was far worse than any reality.
> _"If any man can convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance."
If you are insulted by facts, what does that say about you?_

**Remember your primary intention.**

Epictetus described the ever-present Stoic directive: "to keep our will in line with nature--which is impossible if we go all to pieces whenever anything bad happens."
The Stoic can't control other's actions and tries not to worry. All she can do is what is in her area of control: to keep her will in accordance with nature.
Marcus Aurelius saw it as his stoic duty:
> _"These it is thy duty to observe and without being disturbed or showing anger towards those who are angry with thee to go on thy way and finish that which is set before thee."_

**Have compassion**

Yes, you heard me right. Stoicism isn't a shutoff valve to emotion, numbing the pain. It's a soul-software that helps us inspect negative impressions like hurt, anger, pity and channel them to good use.
But criticism, truthful or not, can still hurt. Be compassionate to yourself and others and forgive, forgive, forgive.

**How to get back**
Marcus Aurelius once again has the answer: "The best way of avenging thyself is not to become like the wrongdoer."
