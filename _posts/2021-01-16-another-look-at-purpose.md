Has anyone ever asked you, "what's your purpose?" and you didn't know how to answer them?

You're probably not alone. There are over 400 talks on TED.com related to the word 'purpose.' There's a market for that question.

We yearn for meaning and fear mediocrity. We feel it imperative to find our purpose for fear that we will miss an existential boat. Or live out a boring corporate job instead of living out a dream of owning a bakery or being an impressionist painter in Paris.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with a little ambition or a dream for creating a better life. Yet, I find amiss the general sense of obsession and desperation about finding our purpose.

The word 'purpose' has been hijacked and shrouded in enigma and mystery so that it will take years of navel-gazing or thousands of dollars of life-coaching to uncover.

I don't believe it's that difficult. Purpose is about design and use - much more pedestrian than becoming a writer or an entrepreneur. We've confused the idea of purpose with seeking for our vocations, calling or mission in life.

What's sad is we think that only by finding our calling or mission in life will we be happy.

What is the purpose of a hammer? Simple! Its purpose is to hammer nails or remove them. You could utilize it for flipping pancakes or as a fly-swatter (with disastrous results), but these poor utilizations would make the hammer (if it could feel) feel out of sorts.

A hammer is "happy" when its use conforms to its design, when it is used according to its purpose.
As humans, we an inherited purpose. We don't need to go far to find it. We only need to recognize it in ourselves.
