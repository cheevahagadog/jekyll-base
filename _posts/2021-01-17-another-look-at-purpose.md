What's the purpose of a fox? Well, to do fox things. The same for hammers, horses or even proteins at the cellular level. But we seem to get confused when the question reaches us.

Aristotle saw human rational thought ability as our defining characteristic. Exercising this unique trait well to "perform activities of the soul" was "man's proper function." By our design and shape, we can do many things physically, but the world around us is more a tribute to our human ability for ingenuity and rational excellence than our physical prowess. 

We don't exist alone in a vacuum. We are social animals. Like a hammer is most itself driving in a nail, we are most human applying our characteristic ability to reason to society. Isolated from society, we cannot fully fulfill our primary purpose as humans. 

Being a human means you're embedded in a web of roles and relationships. For example, male roles include father, husband, boyfriend, son, friend, businessman, uncle, hunter, employee, etc. The man who is more or less thriving in each of his roles fulfills his inherited purpose.

It takes a level of mindfulness to see that we have chances to fulfill our purpose in our everyday life. It's not to be found after some costly hyped-up seminar. It's right around you. 

Your job as a human -- your purpose -- is to strive to live up to the best of your human capacities in your social roles and with yourself. Be good to yourself. Be excellent in your relationships.

It's as easy as it is glamorous, but doing this "human stuff" well creates a foundational level of happiness that satisfies our need for meaning. 

That is our inherited purpose: to live for excellence. It's as simple and complicated as that.

I am almost done talking about this...I think.
