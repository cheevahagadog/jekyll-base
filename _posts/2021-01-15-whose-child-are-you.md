My Dad was a dentist in an Afghanistan prison operating on captured Al-Queda soldiers and militants. One day before he began to work on a teenage prisoner, my Dad asked him, “So why are you here?” He replied, “Man, I was just born at the wrong time in the wrong place.”

That story has always stuck with me.

We all spin the lottery of life when we’re born. We have no control over what family we land in or what country we’re born into. At least not until young adulthood, we have little control over our upbringing.

Everybody gets different starting lines and default settings. **We may be created equal, but we are not born equal.**

Seneca wrote in his On The Shortness Of Life that _“We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us, that they were given to us by chance. **But we can choose whose children we would like to be.”**_

Hopefully, we have loving, supportive families but sadly not everyone does. Seneca points out that we can choose to become ‘children’ of great people, ‘households of noble intellects.’ You can call on them anytime and “[they] will [never] be too busy to see you...or allow you to depart empty-handed.”

We become the children of others when we learn from their teachings, try to copy their behavior, and take on their attributes.

Choosing our adoption house means choosing a philosophy, faith, or creed that resonates with us. We then inherit all that it has to offer, even if our actual family circumstances are meager.

Seneca’s Stoicism reminds us of our power to choose and act. We can decide where the scripts we inherited from our family or culture aren’t working and find better ones. 

Whose child are you? Choose wisely.
