Today is Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) day. We remember the civil rights movement and the vision and courage of MLK and many others who fought for their rights against institutionalized racism and segregation.

It is also a day to remember MLK's unfinished vision. Months before his assassination, MLK characterized the ongoing struggle for Blacks:

_"We are in a new era, a new phase of the struggle, where we have moved from a struggle for decency...**to a struggle for genuine equality."**_

Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act of '54, '64 and '65 broke down the barriers of legalized segregation. They are landmark achievements, but **MLK did not see civil equality and economic equality as separable.**

Reacting to images of the fire hoses and dogs and vicious violence of the south, many whites supported the civic reforms towards legal equality but stopped short of genuine equality. 

The next struggle for economic justice was to be against **the less visible villain of indifference.**

The struggle remains. On top of the racial wealth gap, the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately destroying Black-owned businesses. They tend to lack the corporate structures, easy access to credit, large cash reserves and access government aid that non-Black businesses take for granted.

During the protests following George Floyd's death last June, Joe Biden declared, "We've had talk before; we had protest before. We've got to now vow to make this at least an era of action and reverse the systemic racism with long-overdue concrete changes."

2021 could finally be when we move as a nation towards MLK's dream for genuine equality. 

Start now by supporting Black or minority-owned businesses in your area.
