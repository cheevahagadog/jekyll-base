_"Be free! Freedom leads to happiness. It's not for us to tell you what to do or want. Your future is limitless. Dream big. Look inside yourself. Find your true passion. You do you. It's up to you to define your values." Etc. etc. etc._

Commencement addresses and TED talks transmit values like these in our culture to adults of all ages. These messages are good, **but they're ultimately hollow and empty when seeking direction and guidance on what to make of our lives.**

Here are two books that offer real advice on what to make of your life.

In In Tuesdays with Morrie, Morrie, an older man dying of ALS, passes on his life lessons to a younger man, Mitch. In one place, Morrie gracefully sums up how to make a meaningful life:

> _"Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."_
It's a beautiful and straightforward message: devote yourself to these things, and you can't miss.
David Brooks' book The Second Mountain mixes nicely. For Brooks, achievement is great but a life of emotional freedom -- living uncommitted to others -- is not all it's advertised to be. The second mountain is where we move from autonomy and success to relation and devotion; from independence to interdependence.
Brooks provides a framework for finding meaning in our lives, similar to Morrie's:

 - Devote yourself to a vocation
 - Devote yourself to a marriage
 - Devote yourself to a philosophy, religion, or creed
 - Devote yourself to a community
 
Both books provide something rare: direction and wisdom. We get to choose what we devote ourselves to. And our joy will match our devotion.
