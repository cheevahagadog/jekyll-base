"Squish" is never a good sound to hear when you step on your lawn. "Squish, squish, squish." I noticed a few swampy spots on my lawn located around by backyard sprinkler heads.

I was out of my depth, with no experience in sprinklers. Had some deep underground pipe cracked and was dumping water into my lawn? I was intimidated by this silent, ever-present leak.

I agonized over it for a month then asked my Uncle for advice. He thought maybe overgrown grass around the head caught too much water, causing it to pool around the head. So we tested that theory by trimming down the grass around each head. Still, "squish."

I was intimidated by my ignorance, bullied by PVC pipes and springloaded nozzles that shoot water, like a new kid in a neighborhood afraid of the big kids with the water guns. I was a sprinkler coward.

A few more months went by with "squish, squish, squish" every time I mowed my lawn, until one day I'd had enough. I was going to research on YouTube on this unknowable problem until I got some answers, come hell or, well, more water.

I finally got an idea of what the problem might be from a dull but in-depth video: the solenoids in my control box. 

So I went out, put on gardening gloves, removed the vines covering the box, found the zone and opened up the solenoid. Yep, there it was, a small jagged piece of metal that was preventing the valves from sealing off, creating a constant flow of water and a mini-swamp. 

My assumptions, procrastination, nail-biting, beating around the bush got me nothing but squishes and headaches. After one hour of research and action, it was a simple fix.

Now about my front lawn!
