Today is a turning point for America and me. Despite becoming jaded by years of scandal and disgrace, I felt a gleam of American pride watching today's ceremonies. 

Watching democracy in action, "Politics" -- that Amygdala hijacking word -- seemed for a while, a little less explosive, a little warmer and a little more boring. 

The last five years have been anything but boring. The former president dominated the news almost daily with his distinctive and polarizing style. Whether a loyal supporter, an indignant opposer, or somewhere in between, it's been hard not to have him somewhere in your mind. 

A state of constant enthusiasm or indignation is the fever pitch politics to which we've become accustomed. And it's exhausting.

Someone who's helped me understand politics in a more sane way is David Brooks. He says:
_"Politics at its best is a competition between partial truths. Republicans believe in freedom, Democrats believe in equalityâ€¦ It's about policies, about designing a healthcare system...but we've turned it into our ethnicity. **And when you turn politics into your ethnicity, any compromise is dishonor."**_

We've put more on politics than politics can bear.  Politics was never meant to support our identities. It's important, but it's not that important. And there are better alternatives all around us.

**Life is too precious to be emotionally agitated by politics all the time.** It's not worth your health. It's not worth our social health. I hope the national temperature will lower a bit with what happened today.

**We need politics to be boring again** (if it ever was). I hope for the possibility of not feeling like I have to think or react to what the president is doing every day. 
That's more mental space for those around me.
