Last year, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences put out a report called "Our Common Purpose," which lays out six strategies to find a unifying American identity.

One proposal was to create a universal national service program to "inspire commitment to American constitutional democracy and one another…"

The federal government expecting us to do more besides obeying the law doesn't sound immediately appealing. Especially now. With stay at home orders and other restrictions, haven't we already been asked enough?

Yet as citizens, we serve our country and uphold our rights through public service. The military draft, jury duty, even paying taxes all work together, however imperfectly, to maintain rights and keep our society functioning.

Of course, this would be disruptive to a young person's life. I know first hand. I served for two years before starting college. This time taught me more about myself and others than any freshmen class. Service provides a chance for young people to learn about themselves, see the country and mix with people from different backgrounds and viewpoints.

Cost is a valid concern. The federal government could put $10k for each child born into a tax-advantaged savings plan to fund it. The young adult receives the money after their service, or if they choose not to complete it, the money goes back to the government.

Some may think this wishful thinking, but some studies have found that over two dollars of savings resulted in every dollar spent on youth service programs.

The goal is not merely to give young adults a great experience or even to help rebuild communities. 

**It's to rebuild social trust and reinvigorate a culture of democracy in action.**

**"The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults."**

America is famous for its individualism. But to "repair her faults," as Alexis De Tocqueville put it, **there's no substitute for solidarity** -- people working together to solve problems.

In his essay over a century ago, The Moral Equivalent of War, William James imagined national service's formative power. He writes: 

*"...hardihood and discipline would be wrought into the growing fiber of the people;... our gilded youths be drafted off, according to their choice, to get the childishness knocked out of them, and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas. They would have paid their blood-tax,... they would tread the earth more proudly... they would be better fathers and teachers of the following generation.“*

Universal national service is one of the report's many proposals to energize a renewal of civic faith. In a post-pandemic world, incentivized service may be more pressing than ever before. 

It has the potential to **change how we live, something that agendas and speeches often fail to do.**

Imagine if young adults had equal access to a paid national service for one year. Having practiced working side-by-side with people from different backgrounds and ideologies to solve problems, how much better prepared would they be for college or the workforce? How could it forge an appreciation for public service? 

It is not illusory to imagine that a nation of youth cooperating could rekindle national pride. 
It is common sense.
